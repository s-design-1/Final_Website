    <p><br>I am Anjelyn, Just call me "Anj" for short</br>
    <br>18 years old </br><br> "My hobby is writing my feelings on paper"</br><br>Because for me,
    writing has always been a way for me to express and understand my emotions. Because
    there is something profoundly therapeutic about putting my feelings on paper,  
    whether it’s a moment of joy, frustration, confusion, or sadness,
     the act of writing helps me process these emotions in a way that talking or thinking alone cannot.
      I find that when I write, I can release pent-up feelings, organize my thoughts, and gain clarity on what’s going on in my mind.
    <br>
    <p><br>I also love animie</br><br>What I love most about anime is its ability to evoke emotions—whether
         it’s the thrill of a victorious moment or the sorrow of a poignant loss. </br></p>
    <p><br>I also love nature</br><br> Because it's teach me to be strong —just
     like a tree that weathers storms yet continues to grow-Just as a river carves its path over time,
     I continue to shape my own journey, learning and growing with each step. 
     I’ve learned to face challenges and emerge stronger.</br></p>

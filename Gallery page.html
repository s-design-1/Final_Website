                    <img src="HIPHOP1.jpg">
                    <figcaption>I choose hip-hop dance as a reflection of how 
                        I approach life—full of energy, creativity, and adaptability. 
                        Much like a dancer who adjusts their moves to fit the rhythm and beat of the music, 
                       just like how to adapt and respond to the ever-changing flow of situations and challenges around me..</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The confidence and authenticity in hip-hop dance are qualities 
                        I admire and strive to embody in my own journey, always staying true to myself while embracing the rhythm of life.</figcaption>

            <h2>Event 2: "Knowledge is not just learned; 
                it is discovered, explored, and transformed into wisdom through 
                curiosity, perseverance, and a passion for growth."</h2>

                <figure class="image-container">
                    <img src="ACADEMIC1.png">
                    <figcaption>Academics, for me, are like a personal journey of discovery, much like an artist refining their craft. Each concept I learn
                         is a step toward a larger understanding, and the process of diving deep into subjects mirrors the dedication 
                         I put into improving myself.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>There are moments when I struggle, 
                        whether it's grasping a difficult theory or completing an assignment,
                         but these challenges teach me resilience.Every piece of knowledge
                         I acquire feels like adding a new layer to my foundation.

            <h2>Event 3: "Debate is not about winning or losing, but about engaging in a meaningful exchange of ideas"</h2>

                <figure class="image-container">
                    <img src="debate1.png">
                    <figcaption>This is one of my favorite event because our life is much like a debate—filled with differing perspectives,
                        challenging moments, and constant learning.
                         Just as in a debate, we encounter opposing viewpoints, experiences, 
                         and choices that force us to refine our beliefs and decisions.</figcaption>

                    <img src="debate2.png">
                    <figcaption>In both, there are moments of passion, frustration, and clarity, where we argue with the world around us and 
                        try to make sense of our place in it. Life, like a good debate, 
                        is not always about winning, but about the growth that comes from it. </figcaption>

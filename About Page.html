       <p>As I followed the journey of this event, I was amazed at the diversity of participants from different Institute.
       <br>The experience opened my eyes to the importance of mentorship and knowledge-sharing.
        As a part of the event, I had the privilege of speaking with individuals who had far more experience than I did,
        Mellanie Eslit, Millicent John,many of them, their willingness to teach and guide others was truly heartwarming. 
        It was like being given the "light" of their wisdom to carry forward. I learned that
        the event’s true purpose was not just to showcase talent, but to shine a light on the beauty of human connection. </br></p>
